# Restaurant Billing System
This project is a restaurant billing system implemented in C language. It was developed as a project during the second year of my studies. The system incorporates various concepts of C programming, such as arrays, functions, preprocessors, macros, structures, and file handling.

# Project Overview

The Restaurant Billing System is designed to streamline the billing process in a restaurant. It allows the staff to take orders, calculate the bill, and generate a receipt for the customers. The system supports multiple functionalities, including adding items to the menu, modifying prices, searching specific invoice,managing orders, and generating reports.

# Features

Menu Management: The system provides options to add new items to the menu, modify existing items, and set prices for each item.

Order Processing: It enables the staff to take customer orders, select items from the menu, and calculate the total bill.

Billing and Receipt Generation: The system calculates the total bill, including taxes and service charges, and generates a detailed receipt for the customer.

Reports: It allows generating reports on daily sales, popular items, and revenue analysis.

# Technologies Used:

The project was implemented using the following technologies and concepts:

C Programming Language: Used for coding the logic and functionality of the restaurant billing system.

Arrays: Utilized to store menu items, order details, and generate reports.

Functions: Used to modularize the code and encapsulate specific tasks.

Preprocessors: Employed to include necessary header files and define macros.

Macros: Used to define constants and enhance code readability.

Structures: Used to create data structures for menu items, orders, and reports.

File Handling: Implemented to store menu data, order history, and generate reports.
